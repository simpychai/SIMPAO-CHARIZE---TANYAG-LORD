DATA SCIENCE

Hello, we are students from Mapua University Makati, ready to unleash the world of Data Science.

Health Insights: A Data Adventure!

Let's embark on a thrilling journey through vital health data, uncovering hidden connections and powerful predictions! This analysis dives into three unique datasets, transforming raw numbers into exciting revelations about well-being.
What We Explored:

Demographic, Behavioral & Vital Signs Snapshot! We started by exploring a dataset rich with demographic information,   behavioral indicators, and vital signs. This included looking at distributions of age, BMI, and vital signs like heart rate, as well as understanding patterns in smoking status and hypertension levels. We even used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to distill the most impactful health dimensions.

The Diet & Body Blueprint! Next, we plunged into the world of nutrition and body composition. We mapped out how everything from caloric intake to muscle mass sculpts body fat percentage, even building a super-accurate model that predicts body fat with astonishing precision!

Time-Traveling Through Wellness! Finally, we tracked the monthly pulse of three individuals, unraveling the dynamic interplay between their steps, stress, and BMI. We discovered a powerful link: more steps, less stress!

Why It Matters:
This data adventure isn't just about numbers; it's about understanding the intricate dance of health. From pinpointing key health drivers to predicting outcomes, our findings pave the way for smarter wellness strategies and a healthier future!
